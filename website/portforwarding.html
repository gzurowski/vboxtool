<h1>Port forwarding</h1>
When a session is running within VirtualBox and it is doing a server task
like web or database serving, clients like browsers, etc. must be able to reach the session
from the outside. To
facilitate this, host interfacing or port forwarding can be used.<br><br>Possible usage includes (only a few examples):<br><ul><li>web serving (port 80)</li><li>database serving</li><li>FTP serving (port 21)</li><li>SSH connection (port 22)</li></ul>
<h2>Host interfacing</h2>
For reaching a session from the outside, host interfacing is the normal
procedure. Host interfacing acts like a bridge between the session and
the outside world. The session it self must be configured with a static
IP address (must be different from the host address) and on this
address, the session can be reached from the outside by client
applications like browsers, etc.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>.
Host where VirtualBox is running has IP address 192.168.201
configured. A session of Ubuntu Server is running, with an active
Apache web server on port 80. Host interfacing is configured, session
has 192.168.202 as a static IP address. A browser points to the IP address of
the session, thus: 192.168.0.202. This
request reaches the session on port 80 and the Apache web server
responds.<br>
<h3>Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>not working with Network Manager on Ubuntu (a common
situation on laptops), Network Manager must be disabled</li>
<li>complex, tedious task,&nbsp;for experienced users
only;&nbsp;requires several non-trivial tasks to do, see section
6.8 of the VirtualBox manual for details</li>
<li>not flexible: per session, one configured interface
is needed&nbsp;</li>
<li>client session must have a static
IP-address;&nbsp;configuration procedure&nbsp;is different on
different OS's, even different between several Linux distro's</li>
<li>not able to retrieve session IP address from the
outside (except by a brute force port scan on an entire network segment)</li>
<li>when the session is moved to another server, it is
not certain if that session works right away because the configured
static IP address may be in another network segment, possible without a
proper gateway or net mask configuration, thus not working</li>
</ul>
<h2>Port forwarding</h2>
When a session in configured with port forwarding, it is possible to
reach the session from the outside by pointing to the host at a
particular port. This port is then forwarded by VirtualBox to the
session. The session then can respond.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>.
Host where VirtualBox is running has IP address 192.168.201 configured.
A session of Ubuntu Server is running, with an active Apache web server
on port 80. Port forwarding is configured from host port 8080 to guest
port 80. A browser points to the IP address of the host, with the
configured host port, thus: 192.168.0.201:8080. This request is
forwarded by VirtualBox to the session on port 80 and the Apache web server responds.<br>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>works&nbsp;with Network Manager on Ubuntu</li>
<li>easy to configure, just three&nbsp;commands per
session to apply</li>
<li>very&nbsp;flexible: configuration can take place
on the fly</li>
<li>client
session does not have to be configured with a&nbsp;static IP-address</li>
<li>no need to retrieve the session's IP address</li>
<li>when
the session is moved to another server, it is very easy to re-configure
because port forwarding sessions are no part of the session (vdi file)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drawback(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>when a session is moved to another server, which
naturally has another host IP address, all clients (browsers, etc.)
must also point to the new address, requiring reconfiguration on
each&nbsp;client; however, this can be circumvented by using
another port forwarding schema on the router serving the network
segment of the VirtualBox host</li>
</ul>
<h2>How fits VBoxTool in this?</h2>
Although configuration only requires just three commands, VBoxTool makes it
even easier by automating this process. VBoxTool is capable for
configuring&nbsp;port forwarding for
all sessions, all at once in one command:&nbsp;'vbox autostart';
configuration takes place&nbsp;in&nbsp;/etc/vbox/machines.conf.
As many port pairs as wanted can be applied.<br>
<br>
Example&nbsp;in&nbsp;/etc/vbox/machines.conf: Ubuntu
Server,3392,2022-22|80-80. In this example, the Ubuntu Server can be
reached
with SSH on the host IP address on port 2022. A web server is active
within the session on port 80 and can be reached by pointing to the
host IP address, on the normal web port, 80.<br><br>Note.
Of course, a host port to be forwarded must be unique over all sessions
over the host VirtualBox installation. Say several sessions have to be
reached by SSH (internal port 22). Each session must have another host
port, say session 1: 2022 and session 2: 3022, all&nbsp;pointing to the
same internal session port for SSH, 22. By using VBoxTool, this is very
easy to configure.<br>
